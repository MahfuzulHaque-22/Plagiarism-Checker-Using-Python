# Plagiarism-Checker-Using-Python


we start by defining a set of reference texts to compare the input text to.

We then define a function called preprocess_text that takes in a string of text and preprocesses it by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and stemming the remaining words.

We get the input text from the user using the input function and preprocess it using the preprocess_text function.
